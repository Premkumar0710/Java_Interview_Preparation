ðŸ”¹ Step 0: Start main()
Address address = new Address("Pondicherry");
Person p1 = new Person("Prem", 25, address);
p1.display();


new Address("Pondicherry") â†’ JVM allocates Address object in heap.
address.city = "Pondicherry"
new Person("Prem", 25, address) â†’ JVM allocates Person object in heap.

p1.name = "Prem"
p1.age = 25
p1.address = reference to Address object
p1.display() â†’ prints "Prem lives in Pondicherry"

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Cloning (deep copy)

Person p2 = (Person) p1.clone();

What happens internally:

p1.clone() â†’ calls Personâ€™s overridden clone() method
Person cloned = (Person) super.clone();
super.clone() â†’ Object.clone() (native JVM method)

JVM allocates a new Person object in heap
Copies all fields of p1 to cloned:

cloned.name = "Prem"
cloned.age = 25
cloned.address = reference to the same Address object (shallow copy part)

Next line:

cloned.address = new Address(this.address);
Calls Address copy constructor â†’ allocates new Address object in heap
Copies city value from p1.address â†’ "Pondicherry"
cloned.address now points to this new Address object
Deep copy complete â†’ p2 has independent Person and Address objects

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Display cloned object

p2.display();

Prints "Prem lives in Pondicherry"
Both p1 and p2 have same field values, but different memory for Person and Address

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Modify cloned object

p2.getAddress().setCity("Chennai");
p2.setAge(27);
p2.setName("Prem Kumar");


p2.address.city â†’ "Chennai" (does not affect p1.address.city)
p2.name â†’ "Prem Kumar"
p2.age â†’ 27

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Display original and cloned objects

p1.display(); // Prem lives in Pondicherry
p2.display(); // Prem Kumar lives in Chennai


p1 remains unchanged â†’ confirms deep copy works
p2 is independent â†’ changes do not affect original

ðŸ”¹ Memory Diagram (simplified)
Heap Memory:
-------------
Address Obj 1: city = "Pondicherry"   <- p1.address
Person Obj 1: name="Prem", age=25, address -> Address Obj 1  <- p1

Address Obj 2: city = "Pondicherry"   <- p2.address
Person Obj 2: name="Prem", age=25, address -> Address Obj 2  <- p2


Different Person objects â†’ p1 != p2

Different Address objects â†’ p1.address != p2.address

ðŸ”¹ Summary of Flow

p1 created â†’ points to Address Obj 1
p1.clone() â†’ super.clone() creates new Person (p2) â†’ initially shares Address (shallow)
new Address(this.address) â†’ creates independent Address object â†’ deep copy complete
Modify p2 â†’ only affects p2, p1 unchanged
display() shows separate results
