# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that organizes software design around **objects** rather than functions and logic.

---

## 1. Encapsulation
- **What:** Wrapping data (fields/variables) and behavior (methods) together inside a single unit (class).
- **Why:** Provides **data hiding** and ensures controlled access to fields using getters/setters.
- **Analogy:** A capsule in medicine hides the powder inside, only exposing a safe outer shell.

---

## 2. Inheritance
- **What:** Mechanism where one class acquires properties and behaviors of another class using the `extends` keyword.
- **Why:** Promotes code reusability and hierarchical classification.
- **Analogy:** A child inherits traits from parents, but can also have additional traits of its own.

---

## 3. Polymorphism
- **What:** Ability of an object to take multiple forms (many behaviors).
- **Types:**
    - **Compile-time polymorphism (Method Overloading)** → Same method name, different parameter lists.
    - **Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)** → Subclass provides its own implementation of a method from parent class.
- **Why:** Improves flexibility and reusability of code.
- **Analogy:** A person can be a student at school, an employee at work, and a customer at a shop.

---

## 4. Abstraction
- **What:** Hiding internal implementation details and showing only the essential features.
- **How:** Achieved using **abstract classes** and **interfaces** in Java.
- **Why:** Reduces complexity, increases maintainability.
- **Analogy:** When driving a car, you only use the steering and pedals without knowing the internal engine details.

## Quick Comparison
| Concept       | Key Idea                              | Example in Real Life      |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Encapsulation | Hiding data inside class              | Bank Account balance       |
| Inheritance   | Reusing code from parent class        | Parent → Child traits      |
| Polymorphism  | One name, many forms                  | Person: student/employee   |
| Abstraction   | Hiding internal details               | Driving a car              |
